I implemented a portfolio-style website for personal art projects. The page structure is simple for any user,
featuring a navigation menu at the top of the pages (Home, About, Portfolio, Contact). For the development of this website, 
I used Visual Studio Code and added HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the programming languages.
Everything I used is from my own sources. The background images are saved on the computer's internal memory, and the portfolio images are my own paintings.
